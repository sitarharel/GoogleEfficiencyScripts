# Google Efficiency Scripts
An on going project to increase efficiency in my life through Google scripts.

The current iteration involves a streamlining of the event creation process. I personally don't like the extra step of changing which calender a specific event appears in. The solution is to add a quick tag to the front of events I add that should be sorted into a calendar other than the default one. In this case, I have the tags "hw" for my homework calendar and "task" for my task calendar. This process works with a trigger that calls the main method every minute.
